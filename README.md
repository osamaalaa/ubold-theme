Thank you for purchasing Ubold :). The following guideline will help you to get started with ubold and its documentation.


#### Gulp


To install Node visit [https://nodejs.org/download](https://nodejs.org/download/).

To install gulp, run the following command:
```
$ npm install gulp -g
```

When you're done, install the rest of the theme's dependencies:
```
$ npm install
```

From here on out, simply run `gulp` from your terminal and you're good to go!

+  `gulp` - recompiles and minifies theme assets into `dist` directory and starts local server serving the theme.

+  `gulp docs` - starts local server serving the documentation.

+  `gulp build` - recompiles and minifies theme assets into `dist` folder.
